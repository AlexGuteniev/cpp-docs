# `/dynamicdeopt` (Enable C++ Dynamic Debugging)

Debug optimized code as if it were compiled unoptimized.

## Syntax

> **`/dynamicdeopt`**
> **`/dynamicdeopt:suffix <suffix>`**
> **`/dynamicdeopt:sync`**

## Arguments

*`suffix`*\
Specify the file extension for the deoptimized output. One or more of the following comma-separated arguments.

â€¢ `/dynamicdeopt:suffix` <suffix>  lets you change that new suffix from `.alt` to something else. Be aware that if you change the suffix, that the suffix must be changed for every file, and it also needs to match the same name passed to the linker. You typically won't use this switch unless you already have files named filename.alt.cpp and you would prefer a different suffix.

## Remarks

This flag is only available for x64 builds. The linker must also be passed [`/DYNAMICDEOPT`](dynamic-deopt-linker.md) to enable C++ Dynamic Debugging.

Compiling with `/dynamicdeopt` generates additional binaries that are used for debugging. When you debug an optimized file and step into an optimized function, the debugger steps into the alternate binary. This allows you to debug as if you are building unoptimized code while still getting the performance advantages of building optimized code.

Place breakpoints in optimized code and step in anywhere with on-demand function deoptimization

With no options, given `test.cpp` as input your output will include `test.obj`, `test.exe`, and `test.pdb`, as well as `test.alt.obj`, `test.alt.exe`, and ``test.alt.pdb`.

`/dynamicdeopt` requires:

`/DEBUG` or `/DEBUG:FULL`. If you don't specify `/DEBUG`, or `/DEBUG:FASTLINK` the linker will give a fatal error.
If you specify `/INCREMENTAL`, the compiler generates a warning and automatically turns off `/INCREMENTAL`.
If you specify `/OPT:ICF`, the compiler generates a warning that the debug experience isn't as good. This is because ICF can cause functions to be removed from the alt file, which means you can't step into them.

`/dynamicdeopt1` is incompatible with the following compiler switches, which also means that edit-and-continue is incompatible with C++ Dynamic Debugging:

   `/GL` 
   `/ZI`
   `/RTC1`
   `/RTCs`
   `/RTCc`
   `/RTCu`
   `/GH`
   `/Gh`
   `/fastcap`
   `/callcap`
   ALL_CLR_FLAGS AND_ALSO 
   `/ZW`
   `fsanitize=address`
   `fsanitize=kernel-address`

Turn `/GL `off via Project properties C/C++ > Optimization > Whole Program Optimization. Set it to **No**.
TUrn `/OPT:ICF` off in Project properties Linker > Optimization > Enable COMDAT Folding. Set it to **No**.
