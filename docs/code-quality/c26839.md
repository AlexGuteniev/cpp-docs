# Warning C26839

> Array new allocation size is the result of a signed to unsigned narrowing conversion that could result in overflow if the signed value is negative

## Remarks

This warning reports that the size specified for an array new allocation may be the result of the conversion of a possibly negative signed value to an unsigned value. For example:

```cpp
int* CreateIntArray(int size)
{
    int* intArray = new int[size];
    return intArray;
}
```

In the expression `new int[size]`, `size` is signed. The compiler converts the signed value to an unsigned value to calculate how many bytes need to be allocated for the array.
When `size` is negative, the result of that calculation may overflow or have unexpected results.

This check is the same as [`C26838`](c26838.md), but applies only to array new `new T[]`.

This check sometimes fails to recognize that certain checks can prevent overflows because the check is conservative.

This warning is available in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.12 and later versions.

## Example

To fix the previous code example in which the size calculation might overflow due to a negative signed value, introduce a check to make sure it won't. For example:

```cpp
int* CreateIntArray(int size)
{
    if (size < 0)
        return nullptr;

    int* intArray = new int[size];
    return intArray;
}
```
